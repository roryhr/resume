# Rory's resume is online

This is my resume. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

It's been so long I lost track of the source template for this
resume; I'd like to give them credit (whether they want it or not).
Generally speaking, I've opted to keep things simple and deferred to TeX's judgment regarding layout and spacing.
